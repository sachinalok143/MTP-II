	journal = {Journal of Neural Engineering},
	abstract = {High rate classification of imagery tasks is still one of the hot topics among the brain computer interface (BCI) groups. In order to improve this rate, a new approach based on fractal dimension as feature and Adaboost as classifier is presented for five subjects in this paper. To have a comparison, features such as band power, Hjorth parameters along with LDA classifier have been taken into account. Fractal dimension as a feature with Adaboost and LDA can be considered as alternative combinations for BCI applications.}
