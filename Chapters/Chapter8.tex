Now a days,there are many new inventions are happening day by day.Each invention added new comfort to the human life.And, people are also excited for new innovative technologies which provides a little comfort, mind wandering getting predicted  (MW), its effects on emotion are getting studied , in the near future the consequence it brings will be playing a fundamental role . In on our approach we predicted MW with 87\% accuracy with random forest classifier.Different classification techniques were used to predict MW episodes and Alertness periods by putting the values on different algorithms for a better accuracy.The  random forest classifier seems very handy on extracted features as it is accurate on processing EEG data. It can also be observed that the features such as wavelet parameters,Skewness,Kurtosis,first \& second differences,mean,coefficient of variable etc. cumulatively have provided better classification accuracy. We would like to measure physical activities in real-time using our proposed approach and utilize this concept in various places as per need in the future.In real time application(such as driver ,security person attention detection,student attentiveness in the class etc.),to detect if a person is alert or not,the result obtained in this study may be quite help full.There are some studies on the same topic with Deep Learning ( in general Deep Learning give better accuracy than Machine learning),but the accuracy that we have measured is the comparable to them. There are few researches on this and more coming up with more interesting aspects of MW and soon it is predicted to be one of the largely growing topics to work on
